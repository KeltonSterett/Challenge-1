# Challenge-1

## Description
1. In this Challenge we were given a pre exsiting code that had some accessibilty issues that needed attention.
2. I started by viewing the source code and adding in semantic elements that the code was lacking.
3. Then I consolidated the the css classses because there was a lot of repetitive actions in the stylesheet 
4. Made sure all the HTML heading attributes were in sequential order
5. Added a more defined and descriptive title to the page.
6. added alt elements to all imgs to make it meet accessibilty standards.
